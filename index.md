## Introduction

Welcome to my website! I am a Senior Assistant Professor at the School of Political Science and Economics at Meiji University located in Tokyo, Japan. I served as an assistant professor at Nazarbayev University and a postdoctoral associate at Yale University prior to arriving at Meiji. My research falls within the areas of Political Behavior, Political Psychology, Formal Modelling, and Quantitative Methodologies. Specifically, I am interested in the connection between political information and group identity and the mechanism of political decision-making and attitude formation. I received a Ph.D. in political science from the University of California, Davis. I also received a M.A. in political science from Waseda University and a B.A. in politics from International Christian University, Tokyo. Prior to entering college, I grew up in Kobe, a port city located in Western Japan. My works have appeared in *Public Opinion Quarterly*, *International Journal of Public Opinion Research*, *Journal of Theoretical Politics*, *Research & Politics* and *Political Research Quarterly*, among other peer-reviewed journals.
