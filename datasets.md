## Japanese Public Opinion Datasets
This is a list of academic surveys in Japan that involve political questions. Individual level data for almost all surveys are publicly available (some for a fee). Datasets with <strong>English-translated codebook and/or variable labels</strong> are shown as <strong><font color="red">RED</font></strong>, and datasets with <strong>English description (but without English variable labels or codebooks)</strong> are shown as <strong><font color="blue">BLUE</font></strong>. Datasets with <strong>no English</strong> information are shown as <strong>BLACK</strong>.

Note that this list DOES NOT include comparative public opinion datasets that involve multiple countries (including Japan). I am thinking about creating a separate list for those datasets.

Please let me know if there are any broken links or questions!
