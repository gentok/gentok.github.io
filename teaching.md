### Method Notes

I share my notes on quantitative methods and their execution codes (mostly in R, but some in Python 2.7, Stata and SPSS) that I acquired from lectures and/or by myself. Note that there may be my misunderstandings or code bugs. Check more details from [HERE](https://github.com/gentok/Method_Notes).
